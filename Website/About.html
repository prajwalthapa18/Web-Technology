        <h1>ABOUT</h1>
        <p class="par"><p>Hey I’m Prajwal and I’m fascinated about music and cricket. I am 17 years old. I was born and  brought up in a beautiful city named Ghorahi. I enjoy  to music and playing cricket in my free time. I have completed my 12th from Gorkha I’ntl public secondary School located at Ghorahi Dang. I’m currently studying Bsc (Hons) Computer Science at Herald collage Kathmandu. I’m a hardworking and quick learner individual with great personality.From my small age I was really interested in graphic designing and I’ve grown my skills a lot in this field. Before joining Herald Collage, I had some basic knowledge about java scripts and python so I was really excited to learn about that and as I joined here I have learned   many skills related to python and java and I would like to thank my teachers for helping me a lot in my problems. As for my achievements some of my key achievements has been receiving the scholarship as per my academic performance. I have also played district level cricket competition, Kabaddi championship  and Running couple of times representing my school. I have also played interhouse cricket competition and became champion twice and came runner-up once among which I led the team twice. I know these are not huge achievement, but as everyone say we have to find happiness in small moments and achievements and I’m really glad that I got those opportunities to represent my school in the past and I would love to do same for Herald collage if I got the chance to represent my collage in any from and make my collage proud. </p></p>
